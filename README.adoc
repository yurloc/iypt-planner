= IYPT Jury Planner

IYPT Jury Planner is a Java-based application with GUI that is used to fill juries for the *International
Young Physicistsâ€™ Tournament*. It helps to quickly find a distribution of people to juries that not only complies
to the tournament regulations but also satisfies various extra constraints without involving tedious manual work.

== Jury rules

There are a few basic rules for a jury that are implied by tournament
http://iypt.org/Official_Documents/Tournament_Regulations[regulations]:

1. Each jury has the same number of members.
2. The role of jury chairman is occupied.
3. Team leaders cannot be members of jury for a fight where their team participates.
4. Any chairman cannot grade the same team more than twice.

On top of that, there are additional soft requirements, i.e. some _nice-to-have_ properties of the distribution.
For example:

1. example one
2. example two

Satisfying these requirements makes the juries "better", therefore we aim to meet as much of them as possible.
However many of them are contradictory so it is hard to meet one without breaking two others and it is usually
impossible to meet all of them.

== Jury optimization
You have probably guessed that finding the best jury schedule is an
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_optimization[optimization problem]. The typical feature of such
problems is that there is no effective algorithm for finding the best (optimal) solution. This is where
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaheuristic[metaheuristics] weigh in. IYPT Jury Planner is powered by
http://www.optaplanner.org[OptaPlanner], a software library which allows to write applications for optimizing
real planning problems without having to re-implement metaheuristic algorithms.
